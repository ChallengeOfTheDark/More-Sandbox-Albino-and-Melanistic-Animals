# More-Sandbox-Albino-and-Melanistic-Animals

This is a mod for Planet Zoo 1.6.1 which makes it so that out of 4 animals at least 1 will usually be albino or melanistic. It changes the Main.ovl file from Content0 (base game), Content1 (Arctic DLC), Content2 (South America DLC), Content3 (Australia DLC), Content4 (Aquatic DLC), Content6 (Africa DLC) so if you only want to change the albino rate from the base game and not a DLC or vice versa, you can do so. Or you can change it for all of them. Your choice :)
Some animals will appear more often as albinos than others, though I've set their color morph values to be identical. I may tweak this later on if it will be requested. 

Since there are several players interested in this applying to exhibit animals as well, this mod also affects the 8 exhibit animals that also have an albino variant! 
The Southeast Asia DLC animals do not have albino variants.

If anyone encounters any bug or issue with this mod, please let me know so I can try to squash it :D 


**Note: In order to see the albino listing on an existing sandbox zoo, the timer for the sale of the animals existing at the time of your last save (assuming you didn't have the mod installed) must expire so new offers appear, since sandbox saves trade listings too. In a new zoo they'll be there right away.** 

## How to install: 
Backup Main.ovl from: 
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content0
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content1
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content2
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content3
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content4
- steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content6
Depending on whether you want to replace one or more, and place them somewhere you can find them. 
Unzip the files in this mod and add the ones you wish to their respective "Content" folder, overwriting existing files if prompted. 
Done! Enjoy! :) 

If you run into any issues or have ideas for improvements, please don't hesitate to let me know. 

**_I update my mods within the first three days of a Planet Zoo update. If that doesn't happen it means I don't have internet and will update as soon as I get it. 
Please do not update my mods. I will do it myself._**
